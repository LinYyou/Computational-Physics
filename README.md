# Mathematical Algorithms and Random Walks in C
This repository contains implementations of various mathematical algorithms and simulations in C. These algorithms include differentiation and integration methods like the Euler algorithm and the Runge-Kutta 4 algorithm. Additionally, it includes simulations of random walks in one-dimensional and two-dimensional space.

## ## Implemented Algorithms:
### Differentiation and Integration Algorithms
1. **Euler Algorithm**(*LAB II*): A simple numerical method for solving ordinary differential equations(ODEs) using first-order Taylor series approximation.
2. **Runge-Kutta 4 Algorithm**(*LAB III* and *LAB V* ): A fourth-order numerical method for solving ODEs, offering higher accuracy compared to the Euler method.

### Random Walk Simulations
3. **Random Walk in 1-Dimensional Space**(*LAB VI* and *RandomWalk*): Simulates the movement of a particle in one-dimensional space, where the particle takes steps in random directions.
4. **Random Walk in 2-Dimensional Space**(*LAB VI* and *RandomWalk*): Simulates the movement of a particle in two-dimensional space, allowing random steps in any direction.
